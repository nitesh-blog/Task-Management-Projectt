# Task-Management-Project


Given that you have one year of IT experience, it's important to work on a project that highlights your technical skills while also demonstrating your problem-solving abilities. Here's a detailed project idea that will help you stand out during interviews:

Project Idea: Task Management System with Analytics

Tech Stack:
Backend: 
ASP.NET Core

Frontend: 
Blazor/Angular or React

Database: 
SQL Server with Entity Framework 

Additional Tools: 
SignalR for real-time updates, Azure or AWS for cloud deployment, and Chart.js for analytics.

Key Features:

User Authentication and Role Management:
Implement user authentication using ASP.NET Identity.Include different roles like Admin, Manager, and User, each with different access levels and permissions.

Task Assignment and Tracking:
Users can create, assign, and track tasks in real-time.Set deadlines, attach files, and add comments on tasks.Task progress can be marked as Pending, In Progress, or Completed.

Real-time Notifications:
Use SignalR to implement real-time updates for task changes, such as when a task is assigned, updated, or completed.


Task Prioritization and Deadlines:
Allow users to prioritize tasks (e.g., High, Medium, Low) and set deadlines. Include reminders and overdue task alerts.

Dashboard with Analytics:
A dashboard to show task completion rates, upcoming deadlines, overdue tasks, and team performance.Use charts and graphs (via Chart.js or similar libraries) to visualize key performance metrics like completed tasks per user or pending tasks per project.


Search and Filtering:
Implement advanced search functionality where users can filter tasks based on priority, deadline, or assignee.

Admin Panel:
A control panel for the Admin to manage users, view project progress, and generate reports on team productivity.


Deployment on Cloud:
Deploy the application on Azure or AWS, demonstrating your understanding of cloud services.Implement CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines to show DevOps understanding.


Why This Project Stands Out:

Comprehensive Skillset: This project shows full-stack development (ASP.NET Core for back-end, Blazor/Angular/React for front-end), real-time communication (SignalR), and cloud deployment (Azure/AWS).


Practical Relevance: Task management systems are relevant in any organization, and implementing such a project shows you can solve real-world business problems.


User Experience and Performance: A focus on analytics and user roles highlights your understanding of performance, user access management, and data visualization.

DevOps Awareness: Deploying on the cloud with CI/CD pipelines shows you're familiar with modern software development practices, which is a big plus for interviews.


This project demonstrates your knowledge of key .NET technologies while also showcasing your ability to create practical, scalable applications, which will definitely appeal to interviewers looking for candidates with hands-on skills.
